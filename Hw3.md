1) How to check a variable’s type?
We can check a variable’s type by using the function type in Python.
 For example : If we want to check the type of n = 10 (which is an integer – int) :
	              n_type = type(n)
	              print(n_type)
Python will tell you the type of n in the terminal
2) In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
We will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling we that some of the variables have invalid names if we give variables illegal names.
For example : class (because class is one of Python’s keywords), 7a( because it begins with a number), y@( because it contains illegal character @)
